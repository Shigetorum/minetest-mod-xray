A server side mod providing X-Ray view for the [Minetest](https://www.minetest.net/) game engine.

Some screenshots can be found [here](https://github.com/shasait/minetest-mod-xray/issues/1).

## Getting started

* Download as ZIP and extract into mods folder. See [Wiki](https://dev.minetest.net/Installing_Mods) for details.
* In the console enter "/xray"
* Stone and Stone Brick become 80% transparent, so you can see what is hidden behind, e.g. ores.

## Extending

* In init.lua add more node definitions to make them transparent as well.

## License

* MIT License (see file LICENSE)
